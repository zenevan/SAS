covered stones. The city's refuse flows through channels carved into the

## NOTES

**Shop Pricing:**
- All items sold in guild shops cost 50% more than base price
- Example: 10,000p food item sells for 15,000p in shop
- Shop keeper cost (10,000p) + room cost (25,000p) = 35,000p initial investment
- Revenue from markups can eventually recoup this cost

**Room Flags:**
- Most flags are FREE (indoors, light, dark, !mob, !teleport, !summon)
- door flag usually adds 5,000p to room cost
- Special function rooms (shop, bank, healing, etc) have set higher costs

**Mob Behavior:**
- Shop keepers require shop room
- Guild guardian typically placed in arrival/entrance area
- Training mobs require training room
- Travel mobs (your druid/squid) are player characters with scripts

**Expansion Strategy:**
- Build core first (beacon + basic rooms)
- Add shops second (revenue generation)
- Add training third (member skill development)
- Add premium features last (auction, magic services)
