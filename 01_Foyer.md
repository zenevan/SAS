## Description

Polished obsidian tiles stretch across the floor, each one reflecting the flickering torchlight like pools of liquid shadow. The entrance hall opens into a vast space where the ceilings soar overhead, lost in darkness above the reach of the flames. 

A massive phoenix carved from bloodstone dominates the far wall, its wings spread wide in eternal flight. The craftsmanship is exquisite—each feather detailed, each talon sharp enough to draw blood if one were foolish enough to touch. Rubies serve as eyes, catching the light and seeming to watch all who enter.

Heavy ironwood doors lead deeper into the manor, their surfaces etched with scenes of legendary assassinations throughout history. The air here is cool and still, carrying the subtle scent of weapon oil, leather, and something else—the metallic tang of determination and deadly purpose.

Stone benches line the walls, worn smooth by countless members awaiting orders or the return of strike teams. Shadows pool naturally in the corners and alcoves, a reminder that in the Sojourn Assassination Squad, darkness is always a friend.
