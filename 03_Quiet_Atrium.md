## Description

A dramatic shift from the harsh functionality of the rest of the manor, the Quiet Atrium offers sanctuary and healing to those who walk the razor's edge between life and death. Soft emerald light filters through stained glass windows depicting phoenixes rising from ash—the ultimate symbol of resurrection and renewal.

The centerpiece is a circular fountain carved from pure white marble, its waters blessed with healing properties. The gentle sound of flowing water fills the space, creating a peaceful atmosphere that seems to wash away the violence and chaos of the world outside.

Comfortable recovery beds line the curved walls, each separated by silk screens painted with calming natural scenes. The floors are covered in thick carpets that muffle footsteps, allowing healers to move silently between patients. The air smells of healing herbs—lavender, sage, and something more exotic that sharpens the mind while soothing the body.

Small meditation alcoves are tucked into corners, offering private space for mental recovery. Even the most hardened assassin needs time to process the weight of their work, and this room provides that without judgment or interference.
