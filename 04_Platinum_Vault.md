## Description

The unmistakable scent of precious metal fills this austere chamber—platinum, gold, and the cold iron of security. This is where blood money becomes legitimate wealth, where the dangerous work of assassination transforms into cold, hard currency.

Thick iron bars separate the public area from the counting room beyond, where guild accountants work under lamplight, their quills scratching endlessly in leather-bound ledgers. Every transaction is recorded, every payment tracked, every member's contribution documented with meticulous precision.

The walls are lined with reinforced strongboxes, each assigned to a specific guild member and protected by both mundane locks and magical wards. A massive vault door dominates the back wall—dwarven-forged steel three feet thick, its locking mechanism a masterwork of engineering that would take even a master thief days to bypass.

The floor is polished granite, easy to clean and impossible to silently dig through. Heavy chains hang from ceiling mounts, ready to secure large payments or valuable items. Everything here speaks of security, professionalism, and the deadly serious business of managing an assassin's fortune.
