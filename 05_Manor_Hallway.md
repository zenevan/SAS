## Description

This wide corridor serves as the manor's primary artery, connecting the essential facilities of the guild. The walls are constructed from dark stone blocks, each one fitted so precisely that not even a blade could slip between them. Torches in iron sconces provide steady illumination, their flames never flickering despite the absence of any detectable breeze.

The floor is smooth flagstone worn by countless footsteps over the years. Unlike the Great Hall, the hallway's acoustics are deliberately muted—thick tapestries depicting historical assassinations hang at regular intervals, both decorating the space and absorbing sound. An assassin can move quickly here without announcing their presence to the entire manor.

Alcoves set into the walls hold small shrines to various deities favored by guild members—Mask, Bhaal, and others who watch over those who work in shadow. Fresh offerings appear regularly, though no one admits to placing them.

Heavy doors lead off to various chambers, each one marked with a simple bronze plaque indicating its purpose. The hallway itself is always kept clear of obstruction—a professional space designed for efficient movement.
