## Description

This grand chamber serves dual purposes—it displays the legendary achievements of the Sojourn Assassination Squad while providing access to the broader economic markets through auction house services. The room perfectly embodies the guild's philosophy: deadly professionalism deserves both recognition and reward.

Glass cases line the walls, each illuminated by magical light that never fades. Inside rest trophies from contracts that have become legend—the crown of a deposed king, the signet ring of a corrupt guild master, the mask of a rival assassin who challenged SAS supremacy. Each display includes a small plaque describing the contract, though names are often redacted to protect client confidentiality.

The centerpiece is a massive table of polished ebony, its surface covered with auction ledgers and communication crystals that connect to the major trading hubs. From here, members can buy and sell without ever leaving guild security. The convenience of conducting business while surrounded by reminders of the guild's power creates a unique psychological advantage.

Comfortable chairs arranged around the room allow members to wait while bids process or simply to admire past glories. The walls between trophy cases display paintings of famous guild assassins, their faces obscured by shadow but their accomplishments detailed in gold script beneath.

The atmosphere here is one of quiet pride—not boastful, but confident. This is what excellence looks like.
