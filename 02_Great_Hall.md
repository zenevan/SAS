## Description

The Great Hall stands as the beating heart of the Sojourn Assassination Squad, a vast chamber where contracts are distributed, strategies are forged, and legends are made. Long tables of black oak run the length of the room, their surfaces scarred from decades of blade maintenance, map consultations, and the occasional violent disagreement.

Massive iron chandeliers hang overhead, casting pools of golden light that create dramatic contrasts with the surrounding shadows. The stone walls are bare of decoration save for weapon racks displaying everything from throwing knives to exotic poisons—a practical arsenal within easy reach.

The northern end of the hall features a raised dais where guild leadership addresses the assembled members. Behind it, a tactical map of the surrounding territories covers the entire wall, marked with pins denoting current contracts, rival guild locations, and areas of interest.

The floor is smooth flagstone, kept immaculately clean despite the heavy traffic. Every footstep echoes slightly in this space, making it impossible to approach without being heard—a deliberate design choice that prevents surprise attacks within the guild's sanctum.
