## Description

The scent of hay, leather, and exotic creatures fills this well-maintained stable. Unlike common stables that house only horses, this facility accommodates the diverse and sometimes dangerous mounts preferred by professional assassins—everything from silent-hooved nightmares to flying creatures that serve as aerial escape routes.

Individual stalls line both walls, each reinforced to contain even the most aggressive or magical beasts. The floors are packed earth covered with fresh straw, cleaned multiple times daily to prevent disease. A central aisle runs the length of the building, wide enough for even large creatures to move comfortably.

Tack rooms at either end hold saddles, bridles, and specialized equipment for various mount types. Everything is organized by member, each set of gear bearing subtle marks of ownership. The walls display grooming tools, veterinary supplies, and emergency restraints for when a mount becomes difficult.

Experienced stable hands move efficiently through their duties, showing no fear even when dealing with the more exotic or temperamental beasts. These professionals understand that an assassin's life may depend on their mount being in perfect condition.
