## Description

The warm scent of fresh bread and roasted meat fills this surprisingly cozy chamber, a stark contrast to the cold professionalism of the rest of the manor. This is where guild members can purchase provisions for long missions or simply grab a quick meal between contracts.

Shelves line the walls from floor to ceiling, stocked with everything from travel rations to gourmet delicacies. The selection is practical yet diverse—dried meats that last months, hardtack for emergency situations, exotic chocolates for celebrating successful contracts, and everything in between.

A long counter dominates the center of the room, its surface worn smooth by countless transactions. Behind it, the shopkeeper maintains inventory with military precision, knowing exactly where every item sits and how fresh it remains. A small kitchen area in the back produces fresh goods daily—bread, pastries, prepared meals.

The floor is swept clean of crumbs despite constant traffic. Small tables near the windows allow members to eat on-site, though most grab provisions and leave. Price lists hang on the wall, updated regularly based on supply and demand.
