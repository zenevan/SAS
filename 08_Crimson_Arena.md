## Description

The metallic scent of blood and sweat permeates this large chamber, though the floors are scrubbed clean daily. This is where theory becomes practice, where new techniques are tested, and where guild members maintain the razor-sharp combat skills that keep them alive.

The main floor is packed earth, soft enough to cushion falls but firm enough for solid footing. It's scored with countless marks from training weapons and real blades alike. The arena is spacious enough for multiple members to train simultaneously without interfering with each other.

Training dummies line one wall—some basic posts wrapped in leather, others advanced automatons that can fight back and react to attacks. The more sophisticated models can even rewield weapons and simulate actual combat patterns, providing realistic practice without the risk of killing a sparring partner.

Weapon racks hold training weapons of every type: dulled blades, padded staves, blunted arrows. A separate rack holds real weapons for those confident in their control. Thick mats are stacked in corners for grappling practice, and climbing walls test agility and grip strength.

An observation balcony overlooks the arena, where instructors can watch and critique technique. The walls display motivational messages written in dried blood: "Train Like Your Life Depends On It—Because It Does."
