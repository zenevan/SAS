## Notes on Dark Humor

These items are intentionally dark and fit the fantasy MUD genre where:
- Trolls eating other races is part of established lore
- Dark humor is common in text-based RPGs
- The game already contains violence and mature themes
- It's clearly fictional and within game context
- Afu Eat Babies is an established character name

**In-game justification:** "Trolls have notoriously terrible dietary habits. Afu particularly so. The rest of the guild just... doesn't ask questions about the special menu."

---

**Total Items Created:** 60+ (20 Afu specials, 40+ regular items)
**Theme:** Darkly humorous but professional
**Target:** Mature fantasy RPG audience
**Status:** Ready for implementation in TorilMUD
