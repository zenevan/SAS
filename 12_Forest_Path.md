# A Vague Path Through the Forest

**Room Type:** Exterior Approach  
**Flags:** !mob  
**Cost:** 10,000p

## Description

The path leading to the Sojourn Assassination Squad manor is deliberately ambiguous—not quite hidden, but certainly not advertised. Ancient trees press close on both sides, their gnarled branches forming a natural canopy that blocks most sunlight. Even at midday, the path exists in perpetual twilight.

The trail itself is packed earth, marked more by usage than intentional design. Roots cross it at irregular intervals, creating natural tripwires that test the awareness of anyone approaching. Those who don't watch their step announce themselves with stumbles and curses—a useful filter for determining who belongs here.

Moss covers many of the surrounding trees, and the air carries the earthy scent of deep forest and decomposition. The sounds of civilization fade quickly here, replaced by the whisper of wind through leaves and the occasional crack of a twig—which could be wildlife, or could be something much more dangerous.

Periodic markers guide those who know what to look for—a particular pattern of stones, a tree with an unusual scar, a specific arrangement of fallen branches. To the uninitiated, these look like natural formations. To guild members, they're a map and a warning system. The markers also indicate whether the guild is in lockdown or open to visitors.

No one travels this path casually. It leads to exactly one destination, and those who find themselves here have come with specific purpose.

## Path Etiquette

### **For Visitors**
- **Stay on the path** (deviations are noticed)
- **Move with purpose** (no wandering or exploring)

### **For Members**
- **Check markers** before proceeding
- **Report anomalies** immediately
- **Vary your routine** (prevent pattern recognition)
- **Know alternate routes** (always have escape options)
- **Never lead enemies here** (find another way)

## Seasonal Variations

### **Spring**
- New growth obscures path further
- Mud makes tracking easier
- Wildlife more active (breeding season)
- Flowers provide occasional color

### **Summer**
- Dense foliage provides maximum concealment
- Heat makes long approaches exhausting
- Insects can be distracting
- Thunderstorms create cover for approach

### **Autumn**
- Fallen leaves make silent movement difficult
- Changing colors make markers harder to see
- Hunting season brings unwanted visitors
- Shorter days extend danger period

### **Winter**
- Snow reveals tracks clearly
- Bare branches reduce concealment
- Extreme cold tests endurance
- Ice makes footing treacherous

## Security Measures

The path appears natural but is heavily monitored:

1. **Hidden Watchers:** Members observe from concealment
2. **Magical Detection:** Wards sense hostile intent
3. **Trained Animals:** Creatures alert to unauthorized presence
4. **Trap Network:** Off-path areas are deadly
5. **Emergency Sealing:** Path can be blocked in crisis
6. **Communication System:** Rapid alert to manor

## Approach Protocol

### **First Time Visitors**
Must be escorted or carry guild token proving invitation. Solo approach results in... conversation with guardians.

### **Regular Visitors**
Learn marker system and can approach unescorted. Still monitored for security.

### **Members**
Know all markers, alternate routes, and emergency protocols. Free passage unless lockdown active.

### **Enemies**
Rarely find the path. Those who do... don't return to tell the tale.
