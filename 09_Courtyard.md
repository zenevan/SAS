## Description

The courtyard serves as the threshold between the outside world and the sanctum of the Sojourn Assassination Squad. Paved with dark cobblestones that remain eerily clean despite the traffic, this open space provides a final checkpoint before entering the manor proper.

High stone walls surround the courtyard on three sides, topped with iron spikes that are definitely not decorative. The fourth side opens to the main road, guarded by heavy iron gates that stand open during daylight but close with ominous finality each dusk. Murder holes dot the walls above, allowing defenders to rain death on any foolish enough to attack.

A central fountain depicts a phoenix rising from flames, water flowing from its spread wings into a basin below. The water runs clear and cold, often used by arriving members to wash the dust of travel from their hands and faces.

Stone benches line the walls, providing seating for those awaiting permission to enter or for members taking a moment in the open air. Several hitching posts allow visitors to secure mounts, though members typically proceed directly to the stables.

The courtyard serves a practical purpose beyond aesthetics—it creates a killing ground where any hostile force must expose themselves before reaching the manor's entrance. Every angle is calculated, every shadow measured. This is where the guild's security begins.
