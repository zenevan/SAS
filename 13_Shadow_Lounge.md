## Description

Unlike the professionally lit spaces that dominate most of the manor, this chamber embraces darkness as both aesthetic and function. Low-burning candles provide the only illumination, casting flickering shadows that dance across walls hung with dark velvet curtains. The darkness here isn't menacing—it's comfortable, intimate, a place where those who work in shadow can finally relax.

Deep leather chairs and couches are arranged in small conversational groupings, each section separated by strategically placed screens that provide an illusion of privacy. The furniture is expensive but well-worn, broken in by countless assassins who've sat here decompressing after difficult contracts.

A long bar dominates one wall, stocked with spirits from across the realms—some legal, many not. The shopkeeper moves silently behind the counter, pouring drinks and dispensing items with minimal conversation. This is a place where questions aren't asked and stories are shared only by choice.

Low tables hold various items for sale: exotic poisons in crystalline vials, rare alchemical components, dark magic scrolls, and tools of the trade not available in more legitimate establishments. Everything is displayed discreetly, and transactions are conducted in hushed tones.

The atmosphere is one of sophisticated darkness—this is where the reality of assassination meets the professional need to appear civilized.
